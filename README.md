# AutoML-OOP with Streamlit

![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)  
**AutoML-OOP** is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that automates machine learning workflows using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. This tool allows users to upload datasets, configure preprocessing steps, train models, and evaluate resultsâ€”all through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless user interaction.
- **Automated Machine Learning**:
  - Data preprocessing.
  - Model selection (classification and regression models).
- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - Display model performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, ROC curves).
- **Customizable Workflow**: Extend or override components (preprocessors, models, etc.) via Python classes.
