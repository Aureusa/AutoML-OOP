Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (or variables) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. It allows for modeling more complex relationships that cannot be captured by a simple linear model.

The general form of a polynomial regression model is:

    y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x² + β₃x³ + ... + βₙxⁿ + ε

Here:
- y is the dependent variable,
- x is the independent variable,
- β₀ is the intercept,
- β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the coefficients of the polynomial terms,
- n is the degree of the polynomial,
- ε is the error term (captures the variance in y not explained by the predictors).

The choice of the polynomial degree (n) is crucial; a degree that is too low may underfit the data, while a degree that is too high may lead to overfitting. Polynomial regression is often visualized as a curve that fits the data points, providing a more flexible modeling option than linear regression.
