Lasso regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting and enhance model interpretability. It achieves this by adding a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.

The Lasso regression objective function is defined as:

    Minimize: ||y - Xβ||² + λ||β||₁

Here:
- y is the dependent variable,
- X is the matrix of independent variables,
- β represents the coefficients of the model,
- λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty,
- ||.||² denotes the L2 norm (sum of squares),
- ||.||₁ denotes the L1 norm (sum of absolute values).

The L1 penalty in Lasso regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, effectively setting some coefficients to zero. This feature makes Lasso particularly useful for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, as it helps in identifying the most important predictors.

Choosing the right value of λ is crucial; a larger λ leads to more regularization and simpler models, while a smaller λ allows for more complexity in the model.
